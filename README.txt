DESCRIPTION:

LiveNotes was my Spring 2020 term project for 15-112, Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.  It is a versatile text editor with the look of a notebook.

SETUP AND USE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install these external librarie: 'import requests' and 'from bs4 import BeautifulSoup' and 'import speech_recognition as sr'.  

2. Download the following files and place all of them in the same folder: LivesNotes.py, cmu_112_graphics.py, Images.py, Page.py, Files.py, Tables.py, Autnotes.py, Symbols.py, Grammar.py, Text.py, words.pkl and moreCommonWords.pkl.

Note: you can only open images in LiveNotes if they belong to the same folder as the other files discussed in SETUP AND USE INSTRUCTIONS (this is a limitation of the graphics library LiveNotes uses).
